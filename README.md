# Principles SOLID.

![Logo de Python](py_img.png)

# The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility.

* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This encourages the use of interfaces and abstract classes to allow for future enhancements without altering existing code.
 
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the functionality of the program.

* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead of one large interface, it is better to have several small, specific interfaces.

* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. In other words, depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
